# Developer Mode Installation

Developer mode (dev mode) is intended to be used for testing and development purposes.

This video shows the dev mode installation.

## Requirements

- [**Multus**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#multus-a-multi-network-plugin) is installed across your cluster and a corresponding `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CRD is created.
- The Kubernetes node must have hardware virtualization support.
  - To validate the support, use this command:

    ```bash
    cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep vmx
    ```
- If you are using an [RKE](https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/) cluster, `ipv4.ip_forward` must be enabled for the CNI plugin in order for pod network to work as expected.

## Installation

Harvester can be installed on a Kubernetes cluster in the following ways:

- Using the [Helm](https://helm.sh/) CLI.
- As a Rancher catalog app, in which case the [harvester/harvester](https://github.com/harvester/harvester) repo is added to the Rancher Catalog as a Helm `v3` app

Please refer to the Harvester [Helm chart](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/blob/master/deploy/charts/harvester/README.md) for more details on installing and configuring the Helm chart.

### Option 1: Install using Helm

1. Clone the GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harvester/harvester.git --depth=1
   ```

1. Go to the Helm chart:
   ```bash
   cd harvester/deploy/charts
   ```

1. Install the Harvester chart with the following commands:
   ```bash
   ### To install the chart with the release name `harvester`:

   ## Create the target namespace
   kubectl create ns harvester-system

   ## Install the chart to the target namespace
   helm install harvester harvester \
   --namespace harvester-system \
   --set longhorn.enabled=true,minio.persistence.storageClass=longhorn
   ```

### Option 2: Install using Rancher

:::tip
You can create a test Kubernetes environment in Rancher using DigitalOcean as cloud provider. For details, see [this section](#digital-ocean-test-environment).
:::

1. Add the Harvester repo `https://github.com/harvester/harvester` to your Rancher catalogs by clicking **Global > Tools > Catalogs**.
1. Specify the URL and name. Set the branch to `stable` if you need a stable release version. Set the `Helm version` to be `Helm v3`.

1. Click **Create**.
1. Navigate to your project-level `Apps`.
1. Click **Launch** and choose the Harvester app.
1. (Optional) You can modify the configurations if needed. Otherwise, use the default options.
1. Click **Launch** and wait for the app's components to be ready.
1. Click the **/index.html** link to navigate to the Harvester UI, as shown in the figure below:

### DigitalOcean Test Environment

You can create a test Kubernetes environment in Rancher using [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) as a cloud provider, which supports nested virtualization.

We recommend using a `8 core, 16 GB RAM` droplet, which will have nested virtualization enabled by default.

This screenshot shows how to create a Rancher node template that would allow Rancher to provision such a node in DigitalOcean:

For more information on how to launch DigitalOcean nodes with Rancher, refer to the [Rancher documentation.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-provisioning/rke-clusters/node-pools/digital-ocean/)
